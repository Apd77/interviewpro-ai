# InterviewPro AI - AI-Powered Interview Simulator

## Project Overview

InterviewPro AI is a web-based AI interview coaching platform designed to help users enhance their interview skills through simulated interviews with real-time feedback. This project integrates advanced machine learning models and computer vision techniques to provide actionable insights, making interview preparation more efficient and effective.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interviewpro-ai.git
   cd interviewpro-ai
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   You can open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to see the application in action.
   
3. **Ensure Dependencies Are Installed**:
   The project doesn't require any complex dependencies to run, as it uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

4. **Access the Demo**:
   Navigate to the `demo.html` file in your browser to try out the AI-powered interview simulation.

2. **About Page**: Learn about the technology powering InterviewPro AI at (`about.html`).
3. **Demo**: Experience the AI interview coaching at (`demo.html`) where you can allow camera access and get real-time feedback.
4. **Contact**: For any inquiries or support, visit the contact page (`contact.html`).

## Features

- **AI-Driven Interview Simulation**: Practice interview questions and receive real-time feedback on responses.
- **Eye Contact Analysis**: AI tracks gaze patterns to help maintain professional eye contact.
- **Smile Detection**: Provides feedback to project confidence and positivity through facial expressions.
- **Speech Analysis**: Identifies pacing issues and excessive filler words in verbal responses.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Detailed performance metrics with actionable insights after each simulation.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data is processed locally in the browser with zero data retention.

## Dependencies

This project primarily uses the following libraries and technologies:
- **HTML5**: For structure and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and functionality.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and others internally (for the actual AI implementation; not included in the current files but mentioned in the context).

No specific package.json is provided, as the project is client-side focused.
